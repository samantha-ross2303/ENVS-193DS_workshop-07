# ENVS-193DS_workshop-07

This is a README! It tells you what is in the GitHub repo.

All READMEs for this class should have the following sections:

## General information

This repo is for tetsing forking and practicing committing and pushing. It also has code for running linear models. 

## Data and file information

What files are there?

What code is there, and what does it do?

## Rendered output

Link to the rendered output. Make sure it is a **working url**. You can test this by sharing the url with someone else to open on their computer - if it doesn't work, that means your GitHub pages set up didn't work.
